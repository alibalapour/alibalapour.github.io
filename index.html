						<h3><i>About Me</i></h3>
					</header>
					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
						Hi! I'm Ali Balapour, a senior undergraduate student at the Sharif University of Technology. My
						main research interests are deep learning and its applications in medical imaging,
						bioinformatics, natural language processing, and interior design. <br>
						I want to broaden my knowledge and experience in mentioned areas by learning theoretical aspects
						and developing experimental sides of these methods in real-life problems. The majority of my
						experiences were on the practical side, and I enjoyed implementing and tuning DL and ML models.
						It's worth mentioning that I am an ML engineer in a tech company, and I have valuable experience
						in the ML industry. <br>
						My research goal is to propose innovative applications to solve current problems in computer
						vision and NLP, focusing on medical applications.

					<h6>
						April 2022 - Present
					</h6>
					<p>

						In April 2022, I joined Multimedia Systems and Complex Networks in the <a href="http://dml.ir/"
							target="_blank"><b>Data Science and Machine Learning Lab</b></a> as a research assistant
						under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rKDtrNgAAAAJ&hl=en"
							target="_blank">Prof. Rabiee</a>. One of our projects in the group is reviewing recent
						domain adaptation and domain generalization methods on functional brain data (like EEG signals,
						fMRI, etc.) and providing a survey paper in this field. My main role is reading and
						comprehending new papers in this area, gathering information about datasets and implementations,
						and preparing infrastructure to organize papers and data efficiently. Our work is undergoing,
						and we are expected to publish a high-quality paper soon. <br>
						In this project, I've learned about different approaches that can be used to solve the domain
						shift problem among distributions. For instance, domain adaptation or generalization can be
						achieved by using meta-learning and self-supervised learning (which are relatively hot topics in
						deep learning). Speaking about soft skills, I've gained experience in <b>team-working</b>, and
						I've
						learned that <b>patience</b>, <b>punctuality</b>, and <b>discipline</b> are the most important
						attributes a
						researcher should have.

					<p>
						In September 2021, I joined the medical image analysis group in the <b>Robust and Interpretable
							Machine Learning lab</b> as a research
						assistant under the supervision of <a
							href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate"
							target="_blank">Prof. Rohban</a>. I had two projects in the lab. The first was
						using novel <b>self-supervised methods on pathology images</b> and pre-training a powerful and
						compact
						pre-trained model to perform well on downstream tasks. The results are decent, but there is
						room for improvement. The SOTA model got 95.82% Macro-F1 score on NCT-CRC dataset, while we
						reached 95.04% Macro-F1 with much fewer parameters.<br>
						In the second project, I developed a model for <b>recognizing acute lymphoblastic cells in blood
							smear images</b>. Our model's performance was fine on ALL-IDB (a well-known dataset) and
						reached 90%
						ACC in zero-shot and 96% ACC in few-shot training. <br>
						We will publish the GitHub repository of both projects in the near future.
